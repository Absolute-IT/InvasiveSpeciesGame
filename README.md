# Setup on Ubuntu 24.04

Need to use GNOME with disabled gestures plugin.

Run `sudo apt-get install gnome-browser-connector`

Then navigate to https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4049/disable-gestures-2021/

Install plugin using Shell version.

This should ensure that gestures are disabled so that multi-touch doesn't minimise the game.
