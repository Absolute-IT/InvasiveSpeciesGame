Kahili ginger has become a major problem in a number of countries, including New Zealand and Hawaii. In Australia, it occurs in New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania. Kahili ginger's popularity as a garden plant increases the risk of it establishing and spreading in Queensland. Kahili ginger suppresses growth of native trees and displaces native understorey plants.",

Groundsel bush was introduced to the Brisbane region as an ornamental plant before 1900.
